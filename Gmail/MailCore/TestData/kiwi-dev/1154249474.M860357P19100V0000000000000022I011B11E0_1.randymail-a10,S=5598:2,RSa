Ok I've committed the code to do the lua stuff, and added a framework  
named "LuaCore".  I figured hey- it's a theme :)

These are basically the classes that I've used in VoodooPad and some  
other stuff.  I added a convenience method:
+ (NSString*) runScriptInBundle:(NSString*)scriptName withInput: 
(NSString*)input named:(NSString*)inputNamed recievingOuputNamed: 
(NSString*)outName;

so that we can run quick scripts, giving input and getting output.   
I'm not sure this is the best way to do things, but I figure I'd give  
it a shot and see how it works out.

I still need to clean up some stuff in LCLuaFoundation, the exposed  
lua calls have stupid names.  And I should note that the  
LuaObjCBridge class is a hacked up version of what you can find on  
the net.

To use the blockquotes stuff, you'll need this:
defaults write com.MacWarriors.Kiwi blockquoteReplies 1

Sounds good to me.
