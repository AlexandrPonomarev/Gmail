Hi there,

I am looking forward to trying out Kiwi, especially since I'm  
starting to outgrow Mail.app.  Although I understand the work  
required for development, I was wondering when the first download  
will be available.  Also, will a feature such as smart folders be  
implemented?  Thanks!

Faisal Moledina
