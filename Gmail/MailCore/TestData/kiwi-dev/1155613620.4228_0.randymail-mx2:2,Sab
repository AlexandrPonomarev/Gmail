<p><b>mronge</b> 2006-08-14 20:46:52 -0700 (Mon, 14 Aug 2006)</p><p>Alot of changes have been made. This checkin is initally going to be a slight step backwark, but the changes are forthe better.<br>
<br>
A bunch of duplicate code has been removed from alot of the model objects, like CTFolder, CTMessage, ..., and factored into a new additions NSSet_Additions.h. Alot of the model objects are under construction right now, and the interface doesnt work as well as before. That's because I am working on moving everything over to bindings. Also, the model \objects have been modified so that they merge better, so for example if there is a new folder it no longer removes all the folders and repopulates. More TODO items are available as well.<br>
