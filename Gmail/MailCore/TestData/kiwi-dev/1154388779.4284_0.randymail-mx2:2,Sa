Heh. Blech, who needs testing when you write perfect code ;) (totally  
sarcastic)

Yea, awesome. prepareForWebDisplay: I've been wanting to get rid of
for some time.

Hmm, not 100% sure what you mean, but I'll check out the code.

OK.

Also, I might go silent for a few days. My powerbook screen is totally  
smashed in, so I don't have a computer. Apple onsite support is fixing  
it right now, but it will take me a little while to get up to speed.  
I've been working on the build system, and I'm working on integrating  
all the frameworks into the Kiwi svn repos. Build times will be  
longer, because MailCore takes quite a while to build, but it will be  
easier in the long run.
