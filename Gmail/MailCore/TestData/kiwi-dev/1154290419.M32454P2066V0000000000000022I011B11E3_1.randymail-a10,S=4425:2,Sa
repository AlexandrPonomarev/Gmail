I've fixed a few minor issues that were preventing Kiwi from building:

- LuaCore now has an install location of @executable_path/../ 
Frameworks so that it isn't hard coded to any path and can sit inside  
Kiwi's frameworks folder. Otherwise, Kiwi will complain during  
runtime and it won't launch.
- Ranlib is run on the liblua.a so that a link error doesn't occur  
when building LuaCore.

Another thing I've been thinking about,  is maybe we should move to  
not including prebuilt frameworks, and build the subprojects from the  
Kiwi project.
Is there a good way to replace frameworks on SVN? Right now I `svn  
rm` the framework and do a commit. Then I add the new build result  
and do a commit, which is kinda cumbersome. Is there a better way to  
do this, or should we eventually go to building everything from  
source (or most things atleast)? Any opinions? Not that this is a big  
deal, just a thought.


Nicolas, ApplescriptCore would be cool. Applescript and I don't get  
along, but if you want to work on it, that's great :)
