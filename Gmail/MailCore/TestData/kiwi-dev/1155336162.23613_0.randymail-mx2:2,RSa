I have to confess that I haven't even bothered to look at the  
coredata schema yet, so it might not be an issue... but I thought I'd  
mention it.

So the way a lot of backup programs work are that they look at the  
modification date of a file, and then if it's changed, copy it over  
to whatever store it uses to stash it away for later use.  If it's an  
incremental backup app, then you'll have multiple copies in the  
backup repository.  Most don't do binary diffs.

So if the file that kiwi uses to store its mail grows and grows and  
grows, and is eventually 1 gig or something insane like that for  
someone- any change to the data store will trigger it for a backup-  
and after 30 days we'll have lost 30 gigs.  Suck!

Do you guys think this is a concern for kiwi?  If it is, I think it  
should probably be something that is addressed sooner rather than later.
