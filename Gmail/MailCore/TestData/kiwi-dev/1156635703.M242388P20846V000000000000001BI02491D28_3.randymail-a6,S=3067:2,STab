Hi Matt

Sorrye we didn't have a whole whack of time to meet up it would have  
been much better to actually have a beer in hand and discuss Mail/ 
mail frameworks etc.   Had I known it was going to take 2 hours to  
process through the store I would have thought twice.

Still it was good to put a face to the name.

Perhaps next year?

Scott
