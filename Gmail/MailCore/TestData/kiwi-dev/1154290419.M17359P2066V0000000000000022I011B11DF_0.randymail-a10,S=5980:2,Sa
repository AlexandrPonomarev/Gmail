Doh- I forgot about that, thanks.  I have all my xcode projects build  
into one directory, and I I don't have to worry about build folders  
taking up all the space for my backups :)

Yea, this will happen every time you check out a static lib.  At  
least, that's my experience.

I'm also wondering- did the project file merge ok?  I've never worked  
with xcode project files and multiple people, so I've got no  
experience there.

What I do with VoodooPad + FlySketch is- I've got a little bin  
directory where I keep various little scripts to do things like  
this.  Here's the one for copying in FMKit, which is a shared  
framework between the two apps:

#!/bin/bash

SRC_DIR=`cd ${0%/*}/..; pwd`

cd $SRC_DIR/lib/fmkit/FMKit.framework/Versions/A/

cp ~/builds/Deployment/FMKit.framework/Versions/A/FMKit .
cp ~/builds/Deployment/FMKit.framework/Versions/A/Headers/*.h Headers/.

touch $SRC_DIR/lib/fmkit/FMKit.framework

That way when I want to update the embedded framework, I just type  
vpcopyinfmkit.sh (and the voodoopad/bin directory is in my path to  
make this easier).  I've also got scripts to make the automator  
actions, make the different plugins that VP relies on, and build the  
whole app.

The script that builds the whole app builds the plugins from scratch-  
I don't keep compiled versions checked in at all.  So maybe one way  
you could handle this is to not have the frameworks we make ourselves  
checked in, but have a script that will build then and put them in  
the right spot so kiwi sees it.
