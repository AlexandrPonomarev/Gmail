Might even help for the AppleScriptCore I was thinking of ;D

Me too, completely. It's easy to go from HTML -> NSTextView (I do  
that a lot here and there) through NSAttributedString, and I'm sure  
that it would be relatively easy to go from NSAttributedString to  
HTML (if it doesn't exist already), since we only have the text style  
blocks to care about...

Sorry I've been away for a week and a little more... I was traveling  
for business' stake
