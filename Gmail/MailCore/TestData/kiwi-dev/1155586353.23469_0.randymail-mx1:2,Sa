That sounds good.  It's not too hard to switch the file storage  
aspect around later on assuming it's got a little bit of abstraction

I do know that at some point people are going to want to make sure  
they have a full copy of all the messages locally, like I did when I  
was flying back from SF on Saturday trying to find an email from my  
mom saying what time her flight was coming in... :)
