Hi Aidan,

It would be great to have another dev working on the project, and I'd  
also love to here about some of your ideas for improving the e-mail  
experience. There is a ton of work to do on Kiwi, and I've spent most  
of my time working on perfecting the engine. I have a list of TODO  
items on svn, so take a look at that list and send a patch to the  
kiwi-dev list, I want to start out with sending patches at first.

Here is the command for checking out:
svn co http://www.svn.theronge.com/kiwi/trunk kiwi

Information on the kiwi-dev list is available on the website. Note,  
that Kiwi is not standalone yet, and it isn't ready to be used as a  
primary e-mail client yet,

Thanks,
--
Matt
