Hello-
Quite by accident, I found out about Kiwi doing a Google search in an  
attempt to find a suitable Mac email client.

I am very excited about this new prospect, and look forward to using  
it.  Is it possible for you to give a general idea of when it may be  
released?.

The screenshots look impressive, and of course, they will only  
improve with time.  I am looking forward to trying and using Kiwi.

Thanks
