Awesome- thanks for setting that up.  I'm awaiting my confirm emails :)

On the crash report stuff- Jonathan Wight of (of toxic software) has  
been working on a crash reporter framework that does pretty much what  
mine does and more.  I pinged him about it and he said it was  
finished and he'd put it out today.  So I'll check that out when he  
releases it and see if that might be a good choice to put in instead  
of rolling my own again.
