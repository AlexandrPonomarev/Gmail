Matt,
Thanks for the quick reply.  As far as what's let her down, it seems  
to center around the fact that she has a TON of messages.  However,  
the symptoms differ between the two apps:
	Mail.app can't even seem to handle simple things like folder  
synchronization for her (it works fine for me, but I don't live in my  
email).  You can put her laptop and desktop side-by-side, sync them  
up, and watch the mis-matching begin - multiple versions of the same  
message appear/disappear, etc.  It just seems buggy overall.  It's  
funny that at Jobs' latest keynote he spoke about implementing "great  
new things" in Mail.app like html templates, to-dos, etc. when I  
think a nice feature would be for it to actually reliably grab your  
mail for you!
	Thunderbird just seems slow overall, although its IMAP  
implementation does seem much smoother.
For either of these apps, here problems could likely be remedied (or  
at least minimized) by a good regimen of organization, archiving -  
sadly I don't think I'll ever be able to get her to do that.  Also, I  
don't want to waste her time by figuring out how to archive for  
whichever application when it may not be the one we stick with.  I  
imagine there are a lot of potential users of your program out there  
who are just like her though - poorly organized and with perhaps  
thousands of messages.  Scary, huh?

Thanks,
Adam
