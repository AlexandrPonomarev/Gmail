I made another lua script to do the formatting for the non blockquote  
formatting stuff, and made some fixes for the blockquote one  
(testing, what's that?).

It would replace most of the code in -[CTMainController  
prepareForWebDisplay:]

Should I check this in?

I also made another change to the lua stuff so that it'll look for  
scripts in a hidden pref dir if set, so a new build of Kiwi isn't  
required just to tweak a script.  Check out LCLua runScriptInBundle:  
for the defaults example.

For the Crash Reporter stuff, Jonathan Wight has been working on open  
sourcing a crash reporter framework he's got.  I figured Kiwi would  
use that instead of the stuff I did, since I'll probably end up  
moving to Jonathan's code for my apps as well.  (He did the  
CToxicProgressIndicator that Kiwi is also using).
