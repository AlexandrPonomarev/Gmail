Kiwi Update
===========

Progress has been slow on Kiwi lately, and I apologize for that. I'm  
a student as many of you know, and I seem to have a ton of projects  
and homework assignments floating around. Recently, there's been a  
bit of progress, like builds no longer fail (yaay!). The client is  
still not functional in it's current state. I've started the process  
of removing glue code and moving to a nearly 100% bindings built app.  
I've learned two things from this experience:

1.	The repository should always be left in a build-able state
2.	There shouldn't be a loss of functionality with a subversion commit

If either situation occurs, development should be done on a branch or  
work should be done in a working copy until both of the conditions  
are satisfied. This might be obvious to most developers, but it  
wasn't until recently that I learned this particular lesson.

With that out of the way...

A new server
-----------
Just today I signed up for a virtual private server through Quantact.  
I've also registered a domain name, kiwiclient.org, which I will be  
moving the Kiwi resources over to. I'm going to be setting up a bug  
tracking system, a wiki, http, mailman and etc, all with the sole  
purpose of supporting this project. So please be patient, some  
resources might go down for a day or so while I move to the new  
server, but it will be for the better.

What about my repository access?
-----------------------------
I've granted a number of people access, but that will be changing  
with the move to the new server. I hate to revoke repository access,  
but I think it will work better if people submit patches to the list  
and I can approve them as deemed necessary. If people become very  
active in the project, I can then grant repository access as is needed.

What can I work on?
------------------
A number of people have asked me what they can work on, I'll be  
putting together a to do list shortly, and I'll be adding  
documentation on the architecture of Kiwi. Once that is up it will be  
easier for others to contribute to the project. I want to put  
together a series of milestones, so that we can incrementally add  
more functionality to Kiwi, and hopefully get off the ground sooner.

So hang in there, I'm working on turning this into a **real** open  
source project. This weekend I want to have the new server up and  
running and a project schedule with milestones.

Thanks for everyones interest,

Matt Ronge
