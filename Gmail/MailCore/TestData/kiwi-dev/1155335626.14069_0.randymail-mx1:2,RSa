how about we get rid of the .a?  I could put the lua sources in the  
framework, and make that part of the build.  This would be good since  
it'll also be easy to do any other architectures that apple is  
working on for the future as well :) (ppc, ppc64, x86, intel-64, etc..)

I can do this when i get back from wwdc, it shouldn't be a big deal.
