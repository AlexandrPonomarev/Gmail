GETTING STARTED

The best way to start learning MailCore is by reading through
documentation intro (in index.html) and the the included example
projects. To run the example projects:

1. Copy MailCore.framework to your ~/Library/Frameworks folder.
2. In each example project, add ~/Library/Frameworks/MailCore.framework
   to the list of Linked Frameworks.
3. Build it!

The documentation isn't as detailed as I'd like. Sorry about that! If
something isn't clear try reading the source included or contact me.

IPHONE USE

reMail has ported MailCore over to the iPhone. Check out their open
